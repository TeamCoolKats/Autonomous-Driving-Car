## 🚗 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a software system that enables autonomous vehicles to drive safely on roads where lane markings are unclear, damaged, or completely absent. The algorithm is tested in both a simulator and a prototype car.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build an autonomous driving algorithm that does not rely on visible lane markings.
- Process real-time sensor input to navigate safely and effectively.
- Support testing in both simulated and physical environments.

## 🎯 Goals and Motivation  
Traditional self-driving systems rely heavily on lane detection, making them less effective in real-world conditions like poor weather or road work. This project aims to fill that gap by developing a more flexible driving strategy that can adapt in those environments.
